Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Nicko A. Venancio, and here you'll find a collection of my recent work in Advance Machine Learning CSST104. This repository acts as a comprehensive guide to grasp and apply fundamental concepts in data analysis and predictive modeling. Covering from basic exploratory data analysis techniques to advanced time series forecasting methods, each subject is extensively explored with practical examples and code samples.

Here's a breakdown:

**Linear Regression**
- Introduction to linear regression
- Simple linear regression
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
- Implementation in Python with NumPy and scikit-learn

**Logistic Regression**
- Introduction to logistic regression
- Binary classification using logistic regression
- Logistic regression for multi-class classification
- Implementation in Python with scikit-learn

**Multiple Linear Regression**
- Extension of simple linear regression to multiple predictors
- Assumptions and interpretation of coefficients
- Feature scaling and regularization techniques
- Implementation in Python with scikit-learn

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Overview of EDA and its significance in data analysis
- Techniques for summarizing and visualizing data distributions
- Handling missing data and outliers
- Correlation analysis and feature engineering
- Implementation in Python with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- Introduction to time series analysis and forecasting
- Components of ARIMA models: AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), Moving Average (MA)
- Parameter selection and model diagnostics
- Implementation in Python with statsmodels

Feel free to delve into each topic for a deeper understanding and practical application!
